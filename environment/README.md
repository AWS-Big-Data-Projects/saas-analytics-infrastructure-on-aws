# Environment Utilities

This directory contains scripts and configurations that aid in 
environment-specific-variable placeholder resolution and 
managing/deploying application environments.

**Prerequisites**

* [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
* [Terraform >= 1.4.2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
* [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
* Bash shell with version 5.0 or greater.
  * Mac users 
      * Mac comes with an old version of Bash
      * Use `homebrew` to install new version
      * `which bash` should point to `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash`
  * Amazon Linux 2 Users
      * Execute the below statements to upgrade to Bash 5
      * After executing these statements, you can switch to the Bash shell
      by typing: `exec bash`. Note that `zsh` is the default shell for AL2.
        ```
        cd ~
        wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-5.2.tar.gz
        tar xf bash-5.2.tar.gz
        cd bash-5.2
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sh
        bash -version
        ```
* Optional - If you want to deploy this application using a GitLab CICD pipeline,
note the following:
  * The deployment scripts automate the process of getting and setting GitLab CICD
  environment variables. In order for these scripts to work, they must be run
  by a user with GitLab repository "Maintainer" privileges. The scripts will ask
  for a GitLab Personal Access Token in order to authenticate with GitLab.
  * As an alternative, it is possible to hardcode environment variables into
  the GitLab CICD yaml file, but this is not preferred since it will only work
  for a single application environment and is not a secure way to configure secret
  values that the CICD pipeline may need.

## Support for Deploying App to Multiple Environments

An environment is a deployment with unique configurations that can run 
independently in the same (or different) AWS account/region as other deployments.

The application code contains placeholders for values
that need to be set per environment before the application can be
deployed. The placeholders are easy to find, since they are surrounded
by 3 pound signs. 

Here are some examples of placeholders:

#&#8203;#&#8203;#&#8203;ENVIRONMENT_NAME#&#8203;#&#8203;#&#8203;

echo This app is called #&#8203;#&#8203;#&#8203;APP_NAME#&#8203;#&#8203;#&#8203;

One approach to creating an environment-specific deployment for the 
app is to create a Git branch per environment and then
search and replace all of the placeholders and commit those changes
to the environment branch.

This approach works fine but it has the following drawbacks:
* It can be tedious keeping the main branch up to date and the
environment branch and then creating feature branches off of the
environment branch.
* Code might accidentally get checked in that has environment-specific
values hardcoded into the files.
* After pulling the latest code from main, there may be a placeholder
that you may not realize needs to be switched out, then you may try
to deploy to a personal environment with unresolved placeholders.
* There is no out of the box error checking to make sure all placeholders
have been set to a real value.

## Environment Utilities

The environment utilities in this directory help in a variety of ways, 
including not requiring developers to create a Git branch per environment. 

Note: this directory contains a Makefile that has intuitively-named tasks 
for using the environment utilities.

None of the application code depends on the existence of the environment
utilities, so the `environment` directory can be deleted from the application
code if desired.

## Environment Utilities Files

The `environment/app-env-var-names.txt` file contains the names of the application
environment variables. This file should be committed to version control. If you 
add a value here, the environment utilities will consider that variable as a 
required configuration before you can deploy your application. 

The Create New Application Environment Wizard uses the `environment/app-env-var-names.txt`
so that it can know what input is required by the user when creating a new
application environment.

Note: If you want to set a configuration value to an empty string, you should 
set it to the literal word, "blank", and the environment utilities will resolve
the placeholder value with an empty string.

Here is an example `app-env-var-names.txt` file that indicates "APP_NAME" and 
"ENV_NAME" should be treated as required settings:
```
# The application name that is used to name resources
APP_NAME

# The environment name that is used to name resources and to determine
# the value of environment-specific configurations.
ENV_NAME
```

***
The `environment/.environment-<env-name>.json` file is generated by the environment utilities 
when you create or import an environment. It holds all of the configuration
values for a specific application environment. This file should never be 
committed to version control. 

Imagine that our application is called "awesome-sauce" and that we created an application environment called "dev".
Here is an example of `environment/.environment-dev.json`:
```
{
  "APP_NAME": "awesome-sauce",
  "ENV_NAME": "dev"
}
```

The environment utilities also support the following built-in placeholders,
which should NOT be configured in the 
`environment/.environment-<env-name>.json` file:
* CUR_DIR_NAME - this will be resolved to the name of the directory that 
contains the file with placeholders.
* gitProjectName, gitProjectGroup, gitRepoDomain - these will be resolved based
upon the current git repository settings

***
The `environment/.cli-profiles.json` file can be created by users to map AWS CLI profiles
to their application environments. It should not be committed to version control.

If this file is configured, then the scripts under the `environment` directory will
set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to the value that matches the current
application environment. This will make it so that any scripts that utilize the
AWS CLI will do so using the correct profile. 

If all of your application environments utilize the same profile, you can configure
a "default" environment profile that will be used by all environments instead of
configuring a profile explicitly for every application environment.

Here is an example of `environment/.cli-profiles.json`
In the below example, all environments will use the "defaultprofile" except for the
"qa" environment, which will use the "qaprofile". 
```
{
    "default": "defaultprofile",
    "qa": "qaprofile"
}
```

***
The `environment/.current-environment` file is generated by the environment utilities
when you create an environment. It should not be committed to version control.
You can set the value directly by editing this file or you can run `make switch-current-environment` to do it for you.

Here is an example of `environment/.current-environment`
```
dev
```

***
The `environment/utility-functions.sh` script contains all of the Bash shell script
functions that implement the environment utilities. 

You can get a list of functions defined in this file by running `make util`
from the environment folder.

You can directly execute a specific function defined in this file by running 
`make util f=<functionName>` from the "environment" folder. The 
`environment/Makefile` will automatically export all values defined in your
`.environment-<env-name>.json` for the current environment into the shell so
that they are available as environment variables for the function.

## Environment Utilities - Accessing Your Environment Configurations JSON

The `environment/utility-functions.sh` script contains many helpful features.
Most of the features rely upon the values configured in the  
`environment/.environment-<env-name>.json` file being set as environment variables
in the current shell. To simplify this, the `environment/Makefile` automatically
sets the values for the current environment into the shell before it calls the
`environment/utility-functions.sh` script. If you want to call functions in
`environment/utility-functions.sh` directly from your shell, you need to first
set the environment variables like so:
```
source $projectDir/environment/utility-functions.sh export_local_app_env_vars
```

## How to Use Environment Utility Features In The Generated Application

When you generate a prototype project with the Create PACE App Wizard,
it will create a `Makefile` for you that has easy-to-use targets to execute
all of the environment utility features. This file has all of the valuable
functionality of the environment utilities preconfigured for you. For example, 
you can execute the command `make ce` that will kickstart a wizard for creating 
a new application environment for you to use. This `Makefile`, which is located 
in the `environment` directory of the generated project, is designed to drastically reduce any learning curve associated with using the environment utilities. To 
understand the power and convenience of the utilities, read the `environment/Makefile`, which includes comments on what each target does.

Below, several examples are listed for documentation purposes - but remember -
use the `environment/Makefile` targets instead of running the examples below
directly.

### Examples

***
**Execute environment-specific deployments without changing any files or
creating an environment-specific Git branch.**

This feature automates the following steps:
1. Create a copy of a file with placeholders
2. Resolve all of the placeholders in the file
3. Execute a command against the file
* Examples
    * `terraform apply`
    * `cloudformation deploy`
4. Delete the resolved file
5. Restore the original file copy

Below are some common examples.

Exectute a Terraform module called "myModule" that has placeholders 
in its `terraform.tfvars` and `backend.tf` files:
```
cd $projectDirectory/environment

./utility-functions.sh exec_tf_for_env myModule
```

Running the above command will result in "terraform apply" being run on your module.
If you want to run another Terraform command, such as "destroy" or "plan", 
you can do so by setting the `TF_MODE` environment variable. Here is an example:
```
cd $projectDirectory/environment

export TF_MODE=destroy && ./utility-functions.sh exec_tf_for_env myModule
```

Exectute a CDK v2 (TypeScript) module called "myModule" that has placeholders 
in the .ts files in the `bin` and `lib` directories:
```
cd $projectDirectory/environment

./utility-functions.sh exec_cdk_for_env myModule
```

Running the above command will result in "cdk deploy" being run on your module.
If you want to run another cdk command, such as "synth" or "destroy" or "diff", 
you can do so by setting the `CDK_MODE` environment variable. Here is an example:
```
cd $projectDirectory/environment

export CDK_MODE=destroy && ./utility-functions.sh exec_cdk_for_env myModule
```

Exectute a CloudFormation module called "myModule" that has placeholders 
in the CloudFormation template file:
```
cd $projectDirectory/environment

./utility-functions.sh exec_cf_for_env myModule
```

Run arbitrary commands on templates after placeholders have been
resolved, then restore the templates back to their original state
before the placeholder resolution took place.

The easiest way to run arbitrary commands is to create a script that will
run all of your commands. For example, we can create a "my-script.sh" file
under the build-script directory and then call it like so:

```
cd $projectDirectory/environment

./utility-functions.sh exec_command_for_env "../build-script" "bash my-script.sh"
```

Here is a more manual approach to doing the same thing.
In the below example, we replace placeholder values in all template files located
in the "my-template-dir" directory, but we take a backup copy of the 
files before we change them. Next, we can run any arbitrary commands we want
on the resolved templates. Finally, we put the files back to where they were
when we started. The changed files are deleted and the backup files are
reinstated, leaving no local file changes behind.
```
cd $projectDirectory/environment

./utility-functions.sh resolve_template_files "backup" "../my-template-dir"

# run arbitrary shell commands now

./utility-functions.sh restore_template_files "../my-template-dir"
```

***
**Look up values from the AWS SSM Parameter Store and Use Them to Resolve Template Placeholders**

This feature is called dynamic placeholder resolution.

You first need to add an entry into `environment/dynamic-lookups.sh` that will
map your placeholder name to an SSM Parameter Store key.

Below is an example that maps the "SSM_MY_CONFIG" placeholder to an SSM
parameter that holds a password value:
```
LOOKUPS[SSM_MY_CONFIG]=/$APP_NAME/$ENV_NAME/password
```

Make sure that `SSM_MY_CONFIG` is also listed in `environment/app-env-var-names.txt`.

Dynamic resolution is turned off by default. When off, it will result in all
dynamic placeholders listed in the `environment/dynamic-lookups.sh` file
being set to blank strings.

To turn dynamic resolution on, set the `DYNAMIC_RESOLUTION` environment
variable to "y". If you want the resolution process to fail if an SSM
lookup fails, set the `FAIL_ON_LOOKUP_ERROR` environment variable to "y".

Below is an example of how you can turn dynamic resolution on, set the region that SSM 
parameters will be retrieved from, and configure resolution to fail if
any SSM Parameter cannot be retrieved:
```
cd $projectDirectory/environment

export DYNAMIC_RESOLUTION=y && export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 && FAIL_ON_LOOKUP_ERROR=y && ./utility-functions.sh resolve_template_files
```

If you want to take a backup up of the original template files so that they
can be restored to their original contents later and you want to limit
the template resolution to a subdirectory in your project, you can pass 
in these optional arguments to the `resolve_template_files` function:

```
resolve_template_files "backup" "../iac/roots/example"
```

To restore the template files from the backups, use this command:
```
./utility-functions.sh restore_template_files "../iac/roots/example"
```

***
**Generate New Application Environments**

There is a wizard that guides you step by step through creating a
new application environment. The wizard will output a JSON configuration
file with all of the environment-specific placeholder values. You can 
also choose whether to push the values to a remote store like GitLab CI
or AWS SSM Parameter store so that they may be used by a CICD pipeline.

The Create App Environment Wizard can be run in a "headless" mode if
you preconfigure the JSON settings for the environment manually and
supply the .json file path as the first argument to the script. If
running in headless mode, the wizard will run some input validations
on the supplied JSON and then execute deployments for the initial
infrastructure, such as deploying a Terraform back end or deploying
the IAM role for the CICD pipeline.

```
cd $projectDir/environment

./create-app-environment.sh
```

Here is now to do the same thing with Make
```
cd $projectDir/environment

make create-environment
```
***
**Delete Application Environments**

There is a wizard that guides you step by step through deleting an
application environment.

```
cd $projectDir/environment

./delete-app-environment.sh
```
Here is now to do the same thing with Make
```
cd $projectDir/environment

make delete-environment
```

***
**Sync Local Application Environments With Remote Stores**

Application environment-specific values can be set
1. in a local file
1. in a GitLab CI environment
1. in AWS SSM Parameter Store 

You can download an environment from one of the remote stores into a
local environment JSON file like so:
```
cd $projectDir/environment

make pull-env-vars
```

You can add or update a remote environment based upon your current local application environment configuration like so:
```
cd $projectDir/environment

make push-env-vars
```

***
**Previewing Template Files with Resolved Values**

Let's say we have a template file called "example.txt" and we want 
to print what this file would look like with its placeholders 
resolved with environment-specific values.

<img src="../images/exampleTextFile.jpeg" width="200" height="100" border="1" />

We can print what the file would look like once the placeholders are resolved
against values in the current application environment like so:
```
cd $projectDir/environment

make print-resolved-template-file f=./example.txt
```
Example output:
```
A sample title

Hello world!
```

***
**Validating Template Resolution**

We can validate that all placeholders in all templates can
be resolved successfully like so:
```
cd $projectDir/environment

make validate-template-files
```
Example output:
```
Template Resolution Result Summary
   MODE:    DRY_RUN
   SUCCESS: 5
   FAILURE: 0
```

***
**Permanent Template Resolution**

We can resolve all placeholders in all template files and overwrite
the file content with the resolved content like so:
```
cd $projectDir/environment

make resolve-template-files
```

***
**List Application Template Files**
```
cd $projectDir/environment

make list-template-files
```

***
**Export all current application environment variables into a Bash shell**
```
source $projectDir/environment/utility-functions.sh export_local_app_env_vars
```

***
**Extract files to deliver to a customer**

This wizard will copy versioned files to a directory of your choice and exclude
all of the common non-versioned files such as ".git", "node_modules",
and ".terraform".

```
cd $projectDir/environment

make extract-deliverable
```
